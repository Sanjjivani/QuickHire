🔐 QuickHire – Secure Recruitment Management Application

(Cybersecurity Learning Project)

QuickHire is a recruitment-focused web application developed as a hands-on cybersecurity learning project.

The primary purpose of this project is to understand how real-world hiring platforms handle user data, including form submissions, authentication, session management, and data flow, from a web security and penetration testing perspective.

This application simulates common recruitment workflows while acting as a safe practice environment to analyse input handling, validation gaps, and potential security weaknesses in user-driven systems.


🎯 Project Objectives (Security-Focused)

This project was built with the following cybersecurity learning goals:

Understand recruitment application workflows

Analyse form-based user input handling

Study authentication and session management

Identify common security risks in hiring platforms

Practise manual web application security testing

Map findings to the OWASP Top 10

🚀 Core Features
👤 User & Recruiter Workflows

User registration and login functionality

Candidate job application submission

Recruiter-style data viewing (learning-focused)

Multiple user-input fields for testing

Designed to practise:

Input validation testing

Sanitisation checks

Payload injection analysis

🧭 Application Flow

Multi-page navigation

Clear request–response data flow

Client-side vs server-side interaction analysis

Ideal for DOM inspection and form testing

🔐 Security Learning Scope

This project is intentionally used to practise and understand:

Input validation and output rendering

Form-based attack surfaces

Authentication and authorisation logic

Trust boundaries between client and server

Common vulnerabilities, including:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Insecure input handling

Broken access control (learning scenarios)

Mapping application behaviour to OWASP Top 10

📌 Disclaimer

This project is created only for learning, experimentation, and skill development.
All testing should be performed locally on this application only.

💡 Mentor Tip

With TaskMaster + QuickHire, you now have two solid security-focused projects.
Next upgrades I recommend:

Add a “Sample Security Findings” section

Add Future Improvements / Hardening Ideas

Link this project in your resume & LinkedIn

Use it as a demo app for XSS & form testing write-ups

If you want, I can:

Make this bug-bounty style

Rewrite it for resume bullets

Or add a threat model section

Just say the word 🔥

make it more proper it look like it make from chatgpr make it like human write it 

Got you. This is a human-written, natural, slightly imperfect but professional README — the kind that looks like it came from a real cybersecurity student, not an AI.
Tone is calm, simple, and genuine. No over-polishing.

You can safely use this on GitHub, resume links, or LinkedIn.

QuickHire – Secure Recruitment Management Application

(Cybersecurity Learning Project)

QuickHire is a recruitment-based web application created as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.
The project focuses on understanding how real recruitment platforms work internally, especially how they handle user input, authentication, sessions, and form-based data.

Rather than building a feature-heavy product, the intention behind QuickHire was to observe application behaviour, analyse data flow, and study common security weaknesses that can exist in user-driven web applications.

This project also acts as a safe practice environment for manual web application security testing.

Project Objectives

The main learning goals of this project are:

To understand basic recruitment platform workflows

To study how form-based user input is processed

To analyse authentication and session handling

To identify common security risks in hiring applications

To practise manual web application testing

To relate real findings to the OWASP Top 10

Core Features
User & Recruiter Flow

User registration and login

Candidate job application submission

Recruiter-style data viewing (for learning purposes)

Simple role-based flow understanding

Form Handling

Job application and candidate information forms

Multiple input fields to test validation behaviour

Used to practise:

Input validation testing

Sanitisation checks

Payload testing

Application Flow

Multi-page navigation

Clear request–response behaviour

Easy to analyse client-side and server-side interaction

Helpful for DOM inspection and form testing

Security Learning Scope

This project is mainly used to understand and practise:

Input validation and output rendering

Form-based attack surfaces

Authentication and authorisation logic

Client-side vs server-side trust boundaries

Common web vulnerabilities such as:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Insecure input handling

Broken access control (learning scenarios)

Final note (human to human 🙂)

This project reflects my learning process, not perfection.
It helped me understand how small design decisions can lead to security issues, which is exactly why I built it.
