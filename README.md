🔐 QuickHire – Secure Recruitment Management Application

(Cybersecurity Learning Project)

QuickHire is a recruitment-focused web application developed as a hands-on cybersecurity learning project.

The primary purpose of this project is to understand how real-world hiring platforms handle user data, including form submissions, authentication, session management, and data flow, from a web security and penetration testing perspective.

This application simulates common recruitment workflows while acting as a safe practice environment to analyse input handling, validation gaps, and potential security weaknesses in user-driven systems.


       🎯 Project Objectives (Security-Focused)

This project was built with the following cybersecurity learning goals:

Understand recruitment application workflows

Analyse form-based user input handling

Study authentication and session management

Identify common security risks in hiring platforms

Practise manual web application security testing

Map findings to the OWASP Top 10

    🚀 Core Features
    👤 User & Recruiter Workflows

User registration and login functionality

Candidate job application submission

Recruiter-style data viewing (learning-focused)

Role-based flow understanding (basic)

    📄 Form Handling

Job application and candidate data forms

Multiple user-input fields for testing

Designed to practise:

Input validation testing

Sanitisation checks

Payload injection analysis

    🧭 Application Flow

Multi-page navigation

Clear request–response data flow

Client-side vs server-side interaction analysis

Ideal for DOM inspection and form testing

    🔐 Security Learning Scope

This project is intentionally used to practise and understand:

Input validation and output rendering

Form-based attack surfaces

Authentication and authorisation logic

Trust boundaries between client and server

Common vulnerabilities, including:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Insecure input handling

Broken access control (learning scenarios)

Mapping application behaviour to OWASP Top 10
